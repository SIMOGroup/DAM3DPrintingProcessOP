# Introduction
We propose a new data-driven machine learning platform for predicting optimised parameters of the 3D printing process from a model design to a complete product.

Structure of DAM3DPrintingProcessOP package: 
1. PCEn_CantileverBeam & PCEn_CylinderHollowPlate & PCEn_CooksMembrane: main programs for running 2D solids. 
2. Other functions are given in subfolders. 
3. How to run PolyCompositeFEM2D 
  - Define a new problem following code structures 
  - Run PCEn_....m 
  - Use Paraview to show results in displacements and stresses. 
  - Get output
