# Introduction
We introduce a new data-driven machine learning platform for predicting optimised parameters of the 3D printing process from a model design to a complete product.

Structure of DAM3DPrintingProcessOP package: 
1. main.ipynb : main program for running machine learning problems. 
2. get-data.xlsx : contains simulation data for the input learning parameter
3. 3d model data downloaded from google drive link get data input : https://drive.google.com/file/d/1sLdnlQlcvOziu5o_djaLWI0j2ZfeFQk9/view?usp=sharing
4. How to run DAM3DPrintingProcessOP 
  - Redefine the path to the file get-data.xlsx
  - Extract the 3D model file and put it in the same folder as the variable data
  - Run the main file according to the instructions in the code
  - Get output
